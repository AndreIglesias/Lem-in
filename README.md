# Lem-in
Lem-in is an algorithmic project that focuses on finding the maximum flow in a flow network with limited capacity. This project explores the use of the Edmonds-Karp algorithm to compute the maximum flow and employs Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore nodes by level.

## Overview

The objective of the project is to find the optimal path through a network, simulating the movement of ants through a maze with specific constraints on capacity and flow. This concept has practical applications in various fields, such as traffic optimization, data packet routing, and supply chain management.

## Algorithm Details

- **Edmonds-Karp Algorithm**: A variant of the Ford-Fulkerson method, which uses BFS to find augmenting paths in the flow network. It ensures the maximum flow is computed efficiently and reliably.

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: A traversal algorithm that explores nodes level-by-level, facilitating the identification of the shortest paths and augmenting paths for the flow algorithm.
